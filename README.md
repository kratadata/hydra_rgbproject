### Arduino code 
`/arduino/HYDRA_small/HYDRA_small.ino `  


Code is structured as follows:  
   1. **Proximity sensors** trigger **lights** based on a certain distance threshold. The threshold can be changed in `/arduino/HYDRA_small/values.h`  
   2. **Touch sensors** trigger **audio** based on a certain touch threshold. The threshold can be changed in `/arduino/HYDRA_small/values.h`.

# The tentacle

A smaller module placed in the center of each community. It is not modulated in real-time i.e. different audio tracks are triggered depending on some values e.x. touch on/off, proximity close/far. It is built out of the following components:

    Inputs:
    1. Sensors: 
       * 4 Touch sensors
       * 2 Proximity sensors

    Outputs:
    2. Audio: 
       * A single portable speaker through line in
    3. Light: 
       * 4 LEDs with optic fibers

# TouchDesigner

![UI](/ui.png)
Interface consists of of 5 modules, that allow the user to monitor the inputs from different sensors.

### üîµSpeech

Based on [Vosk](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/) TTS to facilitate offline speech recognition. The model in use is [vosk-model-small-fr-0.22](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models). The purpose of this module is to trigger certain sounds based on **trigger words**.
1. Press "Active" to turn speech recognition on/off.
2. Add "Keywords" to filter out **trigger words**. The blue square next to it indicates that the word was found.
3. The big area underneath displays all sentences. The rectangle with "chan1" indicates microphone signal.
   

### üü£Vision

Based on [MediaPipe TD Plugin](https://github.com/torinmb/mediapipe-touchdesigner), this module runs object recognition model to indicate the number of people in front of the camera
1. Press "Active" to turn camera on/off. 
2. "Object recognition" displays found object in one of the class trained on [COCO dataset](https://storage.googleapis.com/mediapipe-tasks/object_detector/labelmap.txt)
   
**Debugging** If object recognition does not start, press "Reset", next press "Active" off, then "Active" on. Wait for a few seconds.   


### üü¢Sensors

Based on [Arduino code](/arduino/distanceSensors/distanceSensors.ino). It tracks incoming values from two [RHWL-1601](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4007) distance sensors and capacitive sensor (Bare Conductive Electric Paint)
1. Press "Active" to close/start connection with Serial Port. 
2. "Distance Value 1", "Distance Value 2", "Touch Value 1" display the current incoming values.
3. "Distance Sensor 1 Min Max" allows you to change the minimum and maximum range (in cm) for the sensor to take effect on Ableton parameters. 
4. "Distance Sensor 2 Min Max" see above.
5. "Touch Sensor 1 Min Max" allows you to change the minimum and maximum range for the sensor to take effect on Ableton parameters. This varies greatly based on the humidity in the space, amount of people, etc. And needs to be calibrated before each show.


### üü†Audio

Uses TDAbleton extension to create a connection between TouchDesigner and Ableton in the same network. For setup please refer to Network Settings in this README.
1. Press "Active" to close/start connection with Ableton. If connected shows 1 the connection was sucessful.
2. Monitor the knobs to see how the values from sensors/camera/speech detection influence different parameters in Ableton.

### ‚ö™Logger

Shows all incoming/outgoing python messages. Useful for debugging.
