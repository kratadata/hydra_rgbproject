# Hydra üêô


## Discussion Points
- Costs of final product and work hours
- Rehersal dates in November
- Configuring Ableton
- Switch to Vosk for offline TTS (lower quality but offline)

### Arduino code 
`/arduino/HYDRA_small/HYDRA_small.ino `  


Code is structured as follows:  
   1. **Proximity sensors** trigger **lights** based on a certain distance threshold. The threshold can be changed in `/arduino/HYDRA_small/values.h`  
   2. **Touch sensors** trigger **audio** based on a certain touch threshold. The threshold can be changed in `/arduino/HYDRA_small/values.h`.

# The tentacle

A smaller module placed in the center of each community. It is not modulated in real-time i.e. different audio tracks are triggered depending on some values e.x. touch on/off, proximity close/far. It is built out of the following components:

    Inputs:
    1. Sensors: 
       * 4 Touch sensors
       * 2 Proximity sensors

    Outputs:
    2. Audio: 
       * A single portable speaker through line in
    3. Light: 
       * 4 LEDs with optic fibers

### Interface

![UI](/images/ui.png)
The interface constinst of 5 modules.

### üü£Vision

Based on [MediaPipe TD Plugin](https://github.com/torinmb/mediapipe-touchdesigner), this module runs recognition model to indicate the number of people in front of the camera
1. Press "Active" to turn camera on/off. 
2. Press "Reset" to restart camera. **Debugging** If object recognition does not start, press "Reset", next press "Active" off, then "Active" on. Wait for a few seconds.
3. "Object recognition" displays found object in one of the class trained on [COCO dataset](https://storage.googleapis.com/mediapipe-tasks/object_detector/labelmap.txt)
4. Select external webcam. <span style="color:red">**IMPORTANT! Select different camera than in Classification Menu**</span>

### üü£Classification

Based on [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train/image), this module runs object recognition model to classifiy the objects belonging to each community. See [TeachableMachine instructions](/TM.md). 

1. Select external webcam. <span style="color:red">**IMPORTANT! Select different camera than in Classification Menu**</span>
2. Place your model ID from Teachable Machine website.
3. Click Pulse next to download model (only needed if updating the model).
4. Click Pulse to reset the model (only needed if updating the model).
5. Using RGB sliders define colors of each community. Depending on the dominant color in the camera view, the community category will be highlighted green. 


### üü¢Sensors

Connects Hydra Head with Ableton [Arduino code](/arduino/HYDRA_big/HYDRA_big/HYDRA_big.ino). It tracks incoming values from [RHWL-1601](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4007) distance sensors, controls LEDs and vaporizers.
1. Press "Active" to close/start connection with Serial Port. 
2. "Distance Value 1" etc. display the current incoming values.
3. "Distance Sensor 1 Min Max" etc. allows you to change the minimum and maximum range (in cm) for the sensor to take effect on Ableton parameters. 


### üü†Audio

Uses TDAbleton extension to create a connection between TouchDesigner and Ableton in the same network. For setup please refer to Network Settings in this README.
1. Press "Active" to close/start connection with Ableton. If connected shows 1 the connection was sucessful.
2. Monitor the knobs to see how the values from sensors/camera/speech detection influence different parameters in Ableton.

### ‚ö™Logger

Shows all incoming/outgoing python messages. Useful for debugging.

---------

### üîµSpeech

Based on OpenAI [Whisper ](https://openai.com/index/whisper/) TTS model. <span style="color:red">**IMPORTANT! Requires OpenAI API Key in order to work**</span>. The purpose of this module is to trigger certain sounds based on **trigger words**.
1. Press "Active" to turn speech recognition on/off.
2. Add "Keywords" to filter out **trigger words**. The bgreen square next to it indicates that the word was found in the spoken sequence.
3. Add your [OpenAI API Key](https://openai.com/index/openai-api/).
4. Change language "en" for English and "fr" for French.
